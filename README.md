### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Quantalabs. I just code whatever I feel like and put it under a GNU General Public License v3.0 no matter what (including this README). You can always see one of my latest projects [here](https://quantalabs.github.io). Other projects I've created include:

* Electron
  * A JS Library that makes graphics easier.
* Dark-Theme
  * Changes a page into a dark theme.
* Disease
  * A disease simulation inspired by COVID-19 and 3b1b.
* Sort
  * Several sorting algorithms

### In Progress
Working on PyChart (haha, get it, PyChart instead of Pie Chart, haha), a python graphics library like manim or matplotlib.

### New Repositories
* DiffPriv
  * A Python Package meant for differential privacy. View on PyPI @ https://pypi.org/project/DiffPriv/ Homepage - https://quantalabs.github.io/DiffPriv
* Climate.py
  * Graphs Global Temperatures from 1880-2020
* Disease
  * Simulates a disease outbreak. Inspired By COVID-19 and 3b1b.

#### Everything (well almost everything) else

I'd love to see more of the community changing and updating the projects and forking them. You can always view any project page @ quantalabs.github.io/*repository-name*. Be careful when typing as the URL is case sensitive.
