### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Quantalabs. I just code whatever I feel like and put it under a GNU General Public License v3.0 no matter what (including this project). You can always see one of my latest projects [here](https://quantalabs.github.io). Other projects I've created include:

* Electron
  * A JS Library that makes graphics easier.
* Dark-Theme
  * Changes a page into a dark theme.
* Disease
  * A disease simulation inspired by COVID-19.
* Sort
  * Several sorting algorithms.
  
#### What I'm working on

Currently, you can look forward to seeing a new version of the disease simulation. I am also thinking about making updates to Dark-Theme. I'm not exactly sure so please go to the repository and tell me what you think I should add.

#### Everything (well almost everything) else

I'd love to see more of the community changing and updating the projects and forking them. You can always view any repositories' webpage @ quantalabs.github.io/*repository-name*. Be careful when typing as the URL is case sensitive.
